# Advent Of Code 2019

## Python

Last year I thought about participating in Advent Of Code because I heard about it on a forum.
After thinking for a while I decided to use Python. 
I couldn't go on after day 9 or 10 because I just didn't know Python well enough, now I do.

This year my goal is to complete all days before the end of december.
Comments and suggestions for my code are always welcome.

If I reach my goal, I will probably participate in Advent Of Code 2020 using Haskell, Scala or Go.
